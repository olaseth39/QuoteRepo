"""
    Let's create a class SteelDimension that calculates the nearest possible dimensions(L, B, H) of a given volume.
    The required_volume is the given volume from which the dimension is to be calculated.
    The volumes have been divided into higher volumes and lower volumes.
    Volumes greater than the required volumes are known as higher volumes, i.e higher_vols.
    Volumes lower than the required volumes are known as lower volumes, i.e lower_vols.
    Volumes exactly the same as the required volumes are known as exact volumes, i.e exact_vols 
    For brevity, higher_vols are returned.
    In a situation where the higher_vols returned does not meet your requirement you might need to reduce the required_volume
